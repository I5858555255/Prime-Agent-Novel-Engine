# Prime Agent Packages

Prime Agent packages bundle extensions, skills, prompt templates, and themes so you can share them through npm or git. A package can declare resources in `package.json` under the `primeAgent` key, or use conventional directories.

## Install and Manage

> **Security:** Prime Agent packages run with full system access. Extensions execute arbitrary code, and skills can instruct the model to perform any action including running executables. Review source code before installing third-party packages.

```bash
prime-agent install npm:@foo/bar@1.0.0
prime-agent install git:github.com/user/repo@v1
prime-agent install https://github.com/user/repo  # raw URLs work too
prime-agent install /absolute/path/to/package
prime-agent install ./relative/path/to/package

prime-agent remove npm:@foo/bar
prime-agent list                     # show installed packages from settings
prime-agent update                   # update Prime Agent and all non-pinned packages
prime-agent update --extensions      # update all non-pinned packages only
prime-agent update --self            # update Prime Agent only
prime-agent update --self --force    # reinstall Prime Agent even if current
prime-agent update npm:@foo/bar      # update one package
prime-agent update --extension npm:@foo/bar
```

By default, `install` and `remove` write to global settings (`~/.prime/agent/settings.json`). Use `-l` to write to project settings (`.prime/agent/settings.json`) instead. Project settings can be shared with your team, and Prime Agent installs any missing packages automatically on startup.

To try a package without installing it, use `--extension` or `-e`. This installs to a temporary directory for the current run only:

```bash
prime-agent -e npm:@foo/bar
prime-agent -e git:github.com/user/repo
```

## Package Sources

Prime Agent accepts three source types in settings and `prime-agent install`.

### npm

```
npm:@scope/pkg@1.2.3
npm:pkg
```

- Versioned specs are pinned and skipped by package updates (`prime-agent update`, `prime-agent update --extensions`).
- Global installs use `npm install -g`.
- Project installs go under `.prime/agent/npm/`.
- Set `npmCommand` in `settings.json` to pin npm package lookup and install operations to a specific wrapper command such as `mise` or `asdf`.

Example:

```json
{
  "npmCommand": ["mise", "exec", "node@20", "--", "npm"]
}
```

### git

```
git:github.com/user/repo@v1
git:git@github.com:user/repo@v1
https://github.com/user/repo@v1
ssh://git@github.com/user/repo@v1
```

- Without `git:` prefix, only protocol URLs are accepted (`https://`, `http://`, `ssh://`, `git://`).
- With `git:` prefix, shorthand formats are accepted, including `github.com/user/repo` and `git@github.com:user/repo`.
- HTTPS and SSH URLs are both supported.
- SSH URLs use your configured SSH keys automatically (respects `~/.ssh/config`).
- For non-interactive runs (for example CI), you can set `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` to disable credential prompts and set `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` (for example `ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=5`) to fail fast.
- Refs pin the package and skip package updates (`prime-agent update`, `prime-agent update --extensions`).
- Cloned to `~/.prime/agent/git/<host>/<path>` (global) or `.prime/agent/git/<host>/<path>` (project).
- Runs `npm install` after clone or pull if `package.json` exists.

**SSH examples:**
```bash
# git@host:path shorthand (requires git: prefix)
prime-agent install git:git@github.com:user/repo

# ssh:// protocol format
prime-agent install ssh://git@github.com/user/repo

# With version ref
prime-agent install git:git@github.com:user/repo@v1.0.0
```

### Local Paths

```
/absolute/path/to/package
./relative/path/to/package
```

Local paths point to files or directories on disk and are added to settings without copying. Relative paths are resolved against the settings file they appear in. If the path is a file, it loads as a single extension. If it is a directory, Prime Agent loads resources using package rules.

## Creating a Prime Agent Package

Add a `primeAgent` manifest to `package.json` or use conventional directories.

```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "keywords": ["prime-agent-package"],
  "primeAgent": {
    "extensions": ["./extensions"],
    "skills": ["./skills"],
    "prompts": ["./prompts"],
    "themes": ["./themes"]
  }
}
```

Paths are relative to the package root. Arrays support glob patterns and `!exclusions`.

### Gallery Metadata

Packages can add `video` or `image` fields to show a preview in future package indexes:

```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "keywords": ["prime-agent-package"],
  "primeAgent": {
    "extensions": ["./extensions"],
    "video": "https://example.com/demo.mp4",
    "image": "https://example.com/screenshot.png"
  }
}
```

- **video**: MP4 only. On desktop, autoplays on hover. Clicking opens a fullscreen player.
- **image**: PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP. Displayed as a static preview.

If both are set, video takes precedence.

## Package Structure

### Convention Directories

If no `primeAgent` manifest is present, Prime Agent auto-discovers resources from these directories:

- `extensions/` loads `.ts` and `.js` files
- `skills/` recursively finds `SKILL.md` folders and loads top-level `.md` files as skills
- `prompts/` loads `.md` files
- `themes/` loads `.json` files

## Dependencies

Third party runtime dependencies belong in `dependencies` in `package.json`. Dependencies that do not register extensions, skills, prompt templates, or themes also belong in `dependencies`. When Prime Agent installs a package from npm or git, it runs `npm install`, so those dependencies are installed automatically.

Prime Agent bundles core packages for extensions and skills. If you import any of these, list them in `peerDependencies` with a `"*"` range and do not bundle them: `@earendil-works/pi-ai`, `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`, `prime-agent`, `@earendil-works/pi-tui`, `typebox`.

Other Prime Agent packages must be bundled in your tarball. Add them to `dependencies` and `bundledDependencies`, then reference their resources through `node_modules/` paths. Prime Agent loads packages with separate module roots, so separate installs do not collide or share modules.

Example:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "shitty-extensions": "^1.0.1"
  },
  "bundledDependencies": ["shitty-extensions"],
  "primeAgent": {
    "extensions": ["extensions", "node_modules/shitty-extensions/extensions"],
    "skills": ["skills", "node_modules/shitty-extensions/skills"]
  }
}
```

## Package Filtering

Filter what a package loads using the object form in settings:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    "npm:simple-pkg",
    {
      "source": "npm:my-package",
      "extensions": ["extensions/*.ts", "!extensions/legacy.ts"],
      "skills": [],
      "prompts": ["prompts/review.md"],
      "themes": ["+themes/legacy.json"]
    }
  ]
}
```

`+path` and `-path` are exact paths relative to the package root.

- Omit a key to load all of that type.
- Use `[]` to load none of that type.
- `!pattern` excludes matches.
- `+path` force-includes an exact path.
- `-path` force-excludes an exact path.
- Filters layer on top of the manifest. They narrow down what is already allowed.

## Enable and Disable Resources

Use `prime-agent config` to enable or disable extensions, skills, prompt templates, and themes from installed packages and local directories. Works for both global (`~/.prime/agent`) and project (`.prime/agent/`) scopes.

## Scope and Deduplication

Packages can appear in both global and project settings. If the same package appears in both, the project entry wins. Identity is determined by:

- npm: package name
- git: repository URL without ref
- local: resolved absolute path
